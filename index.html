<p>     I started my Launchcode journey at the lowest point of my life, and its been nothing but up since then.
I was stuck in a 10 yr long cycle of heroin addiction and had just finally started to get it under control.
I was also recovering from a stroke that came out of nowhere, so I knew I was going to have to find a new career path,
because its kind of difficult to do building maintenence with one working hand. It was my addiction doctor who finally told me about Launchcode.
He said he had another patient that went through the program and it completely turned his life around. At first, he almost made it sound too good to be true.
I mean why would a company take a disabled addict off the street and teach them computer programming for free? But seriously, what did I have to lose?
So I got home that night and looked up Launchcode. They didnt have any current enrollment openings, but after some research I realized it was 
pretty darn difficult to find any negative articles or stories or testimonies regarding their lc101 program. After that night, I went to sleep with some hope 
for the first time in a long while. I made sure to check back every week to find out if a new program was starting and if they were taking any applications.
But finally, after weeks of waiting and checking I saw they had an opening! But, instead of being patient and preparing for the application and assessment test, I decided to
take it right away and fill everything out in the middle of a loud family gathering. Immediately after submitting my applications I realized I got two fairly simple questions wrong. Not a good way to finish a test.
Needless to say, when I finally got the email back I found I did not make the cut this time. But hey, at least I got a little practice for next time.</p>
<p>     I immediately went back to checking for new openings on the Launchcode website. As I was just starting to give up on my Launchcode dreams, I finally found a new opening for the winter of 2018-2019. This time I was not going to be overconfident and ruin everything.
I waited until I had the house to myself one evening and finally I was able to sit down and focus completely while I finished the application
and the assessment test. This time when I hit submit I was pretty sure I got every question right. Once again, I got to go to sleep hopeful and excited about the future.</p>
</p><p> I finally got the email back about two weeks later. I was accepted! It finally felt like my life was starting to turn around. I had finally gotten myself clean and sober,
I was trying to get in to physical therapy for my stroke, and now I could finally start to work on a career I love. If I remember correctly, class started in January 2019.I was definitely a little nervous beforehand. 
In the midst of destroying my life and shooting up illegal narcotics all day, I hadnt had much practice dealing with normal people in normal situations over the last 10 years. Although, when I got to class Monday, I found those fears were unfounded. The instructors introduced themselves and explained
how the course would work, and then we were broken up into teams with a teaching assistant. Everyone was as welcoming and friendly and helpful as they could possibly be
and I could tell on the first day why no one had anything bad to say about Launchcode.</p>
<p>     One unit later, I still love Launchcode and Im still as optimistic as I was the first day. Ive gone from knowing exactly 0 things about
computer coding and being a little lost whenever I start a project, but thanks to the help of my classmates and the super capable and hard working instructors and TA's I am proud of my progress thus far and feel pretty confident anytime we start a new project.
And this is only a unit in. I cant imagine were I will be at the end of the program. Aside from the in class coding progress ive made,
The confidence of knowing Im working on a career I actually care abou has touched all aspects of my life. Optimism can be a powerful thing.
Since I started this program back when I had nothing to my name, things have completely turned around. I now have almost a year clean and sober,
Im saving up a decent amount of money, I finally got in to a pretty good physical therapy to work on my stroke recovery. Ive even changed my diet 
and stopped eating sugar. Im no longer depressed and anxious all the time. I am finally happy and healthy. I owe a lot of that to this program and I imagine things will just keep getting better.
</p>
<p><b><em>CLOSING THOUGHTS:</em></b>I would highly recommend Lanchcode to anyone looking for a career change to something more fullfilling or 
anyone interested in moving to the tech field. They are open and inclusive to anyone from any race, sex, or background. The only requirement for the course is that you
are willing to put in the work to learn the material. If you follow directions and do the prep work you will excel at LC101, and when its all said
and done, have the ability to make computers do what you want. Obviously, going to Launchcode isn't going to magically fix all the problems in your life.
But it will give you a positive future to look forward to if you put in the work. And that can be a powerful thing.</p>
